### Hey, I'm Tony 👋

Welcome to my corner of GitHub — where half-baked ideas meet caffeine-fueled ambition ☕🚀

- 😄 I'm Tony Gheorghe, born on 02/08/1999 (yep, 26 and still figuring things out).
- 🎓 Currently diving deep into a PhD in Industrial Engineering (2024 onward).
- 🛠️ Passionate about DevOps, systems engineering, and making things work when they really shouldn't.
- 🧠 I enjoy tinkering with automation, infrastructure, and occasionally breaking stuff just to fix it better.

- 💬 Got questions, ideas, or memes? Hit me up.
- 📫 You *might* still find me at [tonygheorghe.ro](https://www.tonygheorghe.ro) — unless I forgot to renew the domain 🙃
